# Python Class assignment 

This project demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python. It includes:

1. **Smartphone Class** - A class that models a smartphone with attributes and methods.
2. **Polymorphism Challenge** - A set of vehicle classes demonstrating polymorphism by overriding the `move` method.
3. **Inheritance** - A subclass of `Smartphone` that adds camera functionality.

## Files

- **smartphone_class.py**: Contains the implementation of the `Smartphone` class.
- **polymorphism_challenge.py**: Demonstrates polymorphism with `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`.
- **smartphone_with_camera.py**: Extends `Smartphone` with camera functionality using inheritance.
